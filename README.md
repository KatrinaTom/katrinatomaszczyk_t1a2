### Thought Process

Navigation: What to include and how best to present the documentation. 

Clicking links redirecrts to the Relevent Content.

Only really need to redirect is Contact (Main Purpose)

*(As a further employer, 
I want to easily contact a developer
So that I can offer them a job)*

Everything else can be scrollable on MW/ DT can be easily seen on a screen with hints that there is more.

Result: Simple Navigation/ Reusable compoments/ easy to add more blogs in the future

Home | Contact Me | Blog 

Blog is the one that redirects to a different page, this is so this location can be expanded and more blogs added in the future.

## Reflection

**Worked Well**
* HTML/ CSS - Learning resources available
* Flexbox CSS Layout
* Responsive Design 
* Wireframe/ Opportunity Assessment and Low-Fi Designs
* Practicing Animations 
* Testing on Mobile Devices/ Different Browsers

**Opportunities to Improve**
* New experience with Figma - Steep learning Curve
* Took longer than expected to decide on a design
* Design Revisions while coding (Slow down to go faster in the beginning)
* Certain animations do not work on MW with HTML/CSS
* More practice on Git - Version Control
